# Classifying Medical Conditions from Patient Reviews of Drugs

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict medical conditions based on patient reviews of drugs. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the aim is to develop a model that can accurately classify medical conditions from the content of patient reviews.

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing patient reviews of drugs to identify the medical conditions mentioned in the reviews. By preprocessing the review text, extracting relevant features, and training machine learning models, we aim to predict the associated medical conditions. This approach can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and safety of drugs for different medical conditions.

## Key Tasks
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the patient review text to remove noise and irrelevant information.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the preprocessed text data using techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization or word embeddings.
3. **Model Selection and Training**: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM) to build a classifier for predicting medical conditions.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) on a test dataset.
5. **Deployment**: Once a satisfactory model is obtained, deploy it for practical use, such as predicting medical conditions from new patient reviews.

## Tools Used
- Python: Programming language used for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- scikit-learn: Library for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): Library for NLP tasks such as tokenization and lemmatization.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of using patient reviews and NLP techniques to predict medical conditions associated with specific drugs. By accurately identifying the medical conditions described in patient feedback, healthcare providers can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness and safety of drugs, ultimately leading to improved patient care and treatment outcomes.
